Now that we can move the player, let's have the camera keep up.

# FollowCamera.cs

{: .todo}
* Create a new script "FollowCamera.cs" and attach one to the "MainCamera"
* Give it the following public variables:
```
    public GameObject m_target;
    public Vector3 m_targetOffset;
```
* Point `m_target` at the "Player"
* Set `m_targetOffset` to (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
    * The origin of the player is at its feet, but we don't want to look at its feet
    * We want to look at a point on the player specified by `m_targetOffset`
    * We have set that to be 1 unit above the player's feet

## Follow the Player
The first step is just to follow the player around as it moves.\
We will be using a simple polar coordinate system to express how the camera should orbit around the player

{: .todo}
* Add the following member variables:
```
    float m_distanceCurrent;
    float m_azimuth;
    float m_elevation;

```
* In `FollowCamera.Start()` calculate the position of the target
    * m_targetOffset transformed from *player-space* into *world-space*
* Based on the starting position of the camera and the position of the target,
    * Calculate the `m_distanceCurrent`
    * Calculate the `m_azimuth`
    * Calculate the `m_elevation`
* In `FollowCamera.LateUpdate()` calculate the position of the target again
    * The player may have moved
* Calculate the new location of the camera
    * Based on `m_distanceCurrent`, `m_azimuth`, `m_elevation`, and the updated target position
* Use `Transform.LookAt()` to look at the updated target position

{: .note}
We need to make sure the player moves before the camera, so we'll update the camera in `LateUpdate()`.

{: .test}
Now if you launch the game, you should be able to walk around, and the camera will move with you.\
There is no camera control yet.

## Camera Input
Like with the **Character** we need some player-input for the camera.
