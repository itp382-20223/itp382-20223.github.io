A simple 2D card game for example: [Blackjack](https://youtu.be/yAPVQ8qyJ_w)

## Clone the Repo

![Clone The Repo](images/gitclone.png "Clone The Repo")

This is the starting point for the project.
We will start off with an existing project.

{: .test}
Open your starting project in Unity.
There is one scene in the project. Assets/Scenes/Game.unity
Open the Game scene.
It should look like this...

{: .note }
You Are here

## Tour the Project
In the Project tab, let's look at the Asset hierarchy. This is a fairly typical style of organization where we have folders for each type of asset.
![Assets](images/lab01/assets01.jpg "Assets")

Let's find the cards.
There is no "Sprites" folder. Instead, look in the "Resources" folder. In there, you will find the "Resources/PlayingCards" subfolder.
![Cards](images/lab01/assets02_resources.jpg "Cards")

{: .note}
Since there are over 50 images in this folder, it's much easier to load these images using code.
If we want to load an asset, we should put it into the Resources folder.
We can **only** load files from a "Resources" or "StreamingAssets" folder.
