# Targeting Crosshair
In the "Sprites" folder, you will find Missile_Crosshairs.png.\
![Crosshair](images/lab03/Missile_Crosshairs.png "Crosshair")
* Drag that into the scene to create a `GameObject` with a `SpriteRenderer` on it
* Drag that new `GameObject` into the "Prefabs" folder to create a *prefab*
* Delete the `GameObject` from your scene
	* We don't want a crosshair in the scene to start off, this will be created as needed when the user touches the screen.
* The `GameObject` has a slot on it for "Cross Hair". Drag your new prefab into this slot
	* If you look in the code, you'll see that is the variable `m_crossHair`
	* Unity automatically converts "m_crossHair" into "Cross Hair" for display
* Save your scene

{: .note}
It's not a bad idea to commit (and maybe even push) your project.\
We haven't done much, but it's wise to commit small changes at a time.\
You will need to add your new *prefab* and the *meta* file that goes with it.
