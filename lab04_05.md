# Pipe Prefabs
"Assets/Prefabs/pipe.prefab" is a prefab for the pipe object.\
If you open that up, you'll see that it consists of 2 different prefabs:\
"Assets/Prefabs/pipe_bottom.prefab" and "Assets/Prefabs/pipe_top.prefab".\
The "GameManager" object in the Scene has a **GameManager** script on it,
and that script has a `m_pipe` public variable on it.
* Point that variable to the "pipe.prefab"
    * Drag the prefab into that slot and save the scene
