# InClass 01: Git

Let's get you set up with Git and Unity.

## Sign Up

If you already have a github account skip to the next step.

Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and [Sign Up](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).

## Choose a Git Client

If you don't already have one, [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/).

You may use any git client you wish including terminal. 

{: .note }
I cannot guarantee I can help you with any git client other than Github Desktop or terminal.
I personally use [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/download/). I can also help you with that one.

## Clone the Repo

This downloads a complete copy of the github repo down from the server to your local hard drive.
Choose a location on your hard drive. You'll need to know where this is.
