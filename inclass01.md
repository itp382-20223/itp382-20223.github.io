# InClass 01: Git

Let's get you set up with Git and Unity.

## Sign Up

If you already have a github account skip to the next step.

Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and Sign Up.

## Choose a Git Client

If you don't already have one, [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/).

You may use any git client you wish including terminal. 

{: .note }
I cannot guarantee I can help you with any git client other than Github Desktop or terminal.
