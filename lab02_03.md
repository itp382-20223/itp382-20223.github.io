# QuizGame.Start()
In the class **QuizGame**, look for the **TODO** in the `Start()` function.
```
    void Start()
    {
        ...

        {   // TODO load in the TextAsset for the specified "file"
        }

        // begin the game
        StartCoroutine(RunGame());
        ...
    }
```
* You can get the filename for the **TextAsset** with the static function `GameManager.GetXMLFile()`
* Load the **TextAsset** with `Resources.Load<TextAsset>()`
* Use the **TextAsset** to construct a new **StringReader**
* Create an **XmlSerializer** of type **QuizList** like so: `new XmlSerializer(typeof(QuizList))`
* Use the function `Deserialize()` on your **XmlSerializer** using your **StringReader** as input
* Set `m_list` to the results of the `Deserialize()`
- You will have to convert the output of `Deserialize()` to type **QuizList**.
* Release the **TextAsset** by calling `Resources.UnloadAsset()` with it

{: .note}
A `static` function does not refer to any *instance* of a class.\
This lets us communicate a piece of data between scenes.\
When a scene transitions, the objects are destroyed, but we want this data to pass from one scene to another.\
We have used a static function to get the name of the file from one scene to another.
