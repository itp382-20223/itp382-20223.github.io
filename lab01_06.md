We have finished with the basic requirements for the lab.\
Everyone should now have a working game.\
At this point, we will each choose our path for the completion of the lab.\
We have 3 paths to choose from. You may choose whatever you want, but for full credit, you must complete just 1 of the 3 tasks listed below:
* Programming
* Design
* Art

# Programming
The programming task is to work in the jokers.
* Add the jokers into the deck in `Deck.Start()`.
* Update `Hand.Score()` to accomodate the jokers.
* Each joker can take on the value of any other card in the hand.
* You must choose which card is most advantageous to copy the value from.
* They player also has to the option to give the joker a value of zero if that is the most advantageous.
* A pair of jokers has zero value by themselves.

# Design
The design job should be creative...
* Come up with a creative way to score the hand.
* Use the suit of the cards in some way.
* You can change the number 21, but there must be some way to bust.

# Art
For the artists among us, let's create some art.
* Create a new sprite for the "Hit" and "Stay" buttons. (And apply it to them.)
* Create a new sprite for the score backgrounds. (And apply it to them.)
* Create a new sprite for the "Play Again" button. (And apply it.)
* Create new sprites for the "You Win" and "Dealer Wins" banners. (And apply them. You probably want to change their colors too.)
* You can do whatever you want with this, but try to make them thematically coordinated.
